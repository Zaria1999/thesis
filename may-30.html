    Anti- Asian Immigration Laws <br>
<br>Durring the Gold rush of 1849 people from china joined the flow of migrants to the West Coast. White Americans denounced Chinese 
immigrants as racially inferior and blamed them for white unemployment and depressed wages. Major newspapers published anti-Chinese ads
 articles and cartoons and states restricted employment education and land ownership for asian immigrants 
<p> Beginning in 1875 Congress passed a series of racist immigration laws to bar Chinese immigrantion laws to bar Chinese immigration. 
    In 1882 the Chinese Exclusion Act Barred Chinese immigrants for 10 years and prohibited them from becoming citizens. Soon after racist
     violence in Wyoming and Idaho left Chinese immigrants dead wounded and fleeing their homes. <br> 
<p> Congress Extended and strengthened the act numerious times. In 1888 the Scott Act prohibited long term legalresidents of chinese descent
     from returning if they left the U.S in 1892 the Geray act Required Chinese residents to carry resident permmits or face deportation or 
     imprisonment at hard labor.<br>
<p> Racist immigration laws were extended to all people of Asian descent. In 1917 Congress prohibited immigration from the "Asiatic Barred" 
    Zone." In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge remarking that "america must remain American." signed the immigration Act of 1924 which barred
     all immigration from Asia, including Japan and established and immigration quota system that would stand until 1965.<br>
     <p> Anti-Asian racial bigotry remains prevalent today. Hate crimes targeting the Asian American community have surged in recent years
         increasing 
        by more than 300% in 2021.<div>
